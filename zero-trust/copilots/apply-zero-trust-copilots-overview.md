# Apply the principles of Zero Trust to Microsoft Copilots

This series of articles helps you apply the [principles of Zero Trust](../zero-trust-overview.md) to Microsoft’s Copilots. Zero Trust is a security strategy. It is not a product or a service, but an approach in designing and implementing the following set of security principles:

- Verify explicitly
- Use least privileged access
- Assume breach

Implementing the Zero Trust "never trust, always verify" mindset requires changes to cloud infrastructure, deployment strategy, and implementation.

As a leader in security, Microsoft provides a practical roadmap and clear guidance for implementing Zero Trust. Microsoft’s set of Copilots are built on top of existing platforms, which inherit the protections applied to those platforms. For the details of applying Zero Trust to Microsoft’s platforms, see the [Zero Trust Guidance Center](/security/zero-trust/). By implementing these protections, you are building a foundation of Zero Trust security.

These articles show you how to apply Zero Trust principles to:

- [Microsoft Copilot](zero-trust-microsoft-copilot.md)
- [Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365](zero-trust-microsoft-365-copilot.md)
