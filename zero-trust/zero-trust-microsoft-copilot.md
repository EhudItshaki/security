# Apply principles of Zero Trust to Microsoft Copilot

Before you introduce Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 or Copilot into your environment, Microsoft recommends that you build a strong foundation of security. Fortunately, guidance for a strong security foundation exists in the form of [Zero Trust](zero-trust-overview.md). The Zero Trust security strategy treats each connection and resource request as though it originated from an uncontrolled network and a bad actor. Regardless of where the request originates or what resource it accesses, Zero Trust teaches us to "never trust, always verify."
