# Zero Trust Rapid Modernization Plan

As an alternative to [deployment guidance](./deploy/overview.md) that provides detailed configuration steps for each of the technology pillars being protected by Zero Trust principles, Rapid Modernization Plan (RaMP) guidance is based on initiatives and gives you a set of deployment paths to more quickly implement key layers of protection.

RaMP guidance takes a project management and checklist approach:

- By providing a suggested mapping of key stakeholders, implementers, and their accountabilities, you can more quickly organize an internal project and define the tasks and owners to drive them to conclusion.
- By providing a checklist of deployment objectives and implementation steps, you can see the bigger picture of infrastructure requirements and track your progress.

## RaMP initiatives for Zero Trust

To rapidly adopt Zero Trust in your organization, RaMP offers technical deployment guidance organized in these initiatives.

| Initiative | Steps |
|:-------|:-----|
| **Top priority** | Critical security modernization initiatives: |
